# Face_Analysis-
The project, implemented in matlab, utilizes linear algebra (dot product, Singular Value Decomposition) to analyze different images to find commonalities (eigenvectors) between them, the most correlated images, and the least correlated images. 

The images are 32x32 pixels and coverted into a grascale with values between 0 to 1. Each column in the 1024 X 2414 matrix represents an image. Total of 2414 images.
