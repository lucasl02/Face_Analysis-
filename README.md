# Face_Analysis-
The project, implemented in matlab, utilizes linear algebra (dot product, Singular Value Decomposition) to analyze different images to find commonalities (eigenvectors) between them, the most correlated images, and the least correlated images. 

Each column of the original 1024x2414 matrix represents a 32x32 image converted into a greyscale with each pixel represented by a value from 0 to 1
